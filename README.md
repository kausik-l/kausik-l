# 👋 Hi, I'm Kausik

Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where AI systems come to be stress-tested, debugged, and occasionally bullied into behaving using my causal buddies.

I am a researcher (Ph.D. from the University of South Carolina) working at the intersection of robust AI, causality, and explainability. I build tools that do not just say models are good or bad, but prove it. Or break them trying.

### Do you believe that your model is unfair and unstable? Do you need help picking a better model?
Who you gonna call?? ARC!! I built this causal rating tool to measure robustness (a.k.a. trust issues) and help you choose the better model: [ARC](http://casy.cse.sc.edu/causal_rating)

## About Me

- 🧪 I evaluate AI systems (especially LLMs and forecasting models) under perturbations, confounders, and stress conditions to see what falls apart and what holds up.
- 🧠 I work with foundation models, chatbots, causal inference, and XAI — occasionally all at once.
- 🏆 Winner of Best Student Poster for Rating AI Systems Through a Causal Lens (my Ph.D. dissertation topic) at a university-wide event called Discover USC 2023 and invited to present my Ph.D. work at AIES 2022 DC, FAccT 2025 DC, and IJCAI 2025 DC.
- 🛠️ I like making ideas tangible: check out my [tool](http://casy.cse.sc.edu/causal_rating) for rating model robustness using causal methods.

<!---## 📊 GitHub Stats

![Kausik's GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=kausik-l&show_icons=true&theme=radical)--->

## 🧰 I Work With: 

- Languages: Python, SQL, JavaScript, R, Bash
- ML/AI Frameworks: PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, OpenAI.
- Visualization: Plotly, matplotlib, d3.js (when bored).
- Deployment & Data: Flask, SQLite, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit.

## 🔬 Current Obsessions
1. Making explainability interactive (not one-off) and hypothesis-driven.
2. Testing LLaMA-3.1 on time-series forecasting.
3. Combining causality + model evaluation so we stop treating fairness and robustness like afterthoughts.

## 📂 Featured Projects
1. [AI Rating through Causality (ARC)](http://casy.cse.sc.edu/causal_rating) – Quantifying robustness of AI models under confounders and perturbations.
2. [SafeChat](https://github.com/ai4society/trustworthy-chatbot) – Building safer chatbots very easily.
